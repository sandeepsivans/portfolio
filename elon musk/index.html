                            Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28,
                            1971) is a business magnate and investor. He is the
                            founder, CEO and chief engineer of SpaceX; angel
                            investor, CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.;
                            owner and CEO of Twitter, Inc.; founder of The Boring
                            Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and
                            president of the philanthropic Musk Foundation. With an
                            estimated net worth of around $139 billion as of
                            December 23, 2022, primarily from his ownership stakes
                            in Tesla and SpaceX,[4][5] Musk is the second-wealthiest
                            person in the world, according to both the Bloomberg
                            Billionaires Index and Forbes's real-time billionaires
                            list.[6][7]
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly
                            attended at the University of Pretoria before moving to
                            Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his
                            Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated
                            at Queen's University and transferred to the University
                            of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in
                            economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to
                            attend Stanford University. After two days, he dropped
                            out and with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online
                            city guide software company Zip2. In 1999, Zip2 was
                            acquired by Compaq for $307 million and Musk co-founded
                            X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in
                            2000 to form PayPal, which eBay acquired for $1.5
                            billion in 2002.

                            <br />

                            With $175.8 million, Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, a
                            spaceflight services company. In 2004, he was an early
                            investor in the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla
                            Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman
                            and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in
                            2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar
                            energy company that was later acquired by Tesla and
                            became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a
                            nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The
                            following year, he co-founded Neuralink—a
                            neurotechnology company developing brain–computer
                            interfaces—and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction
                            company. Musk has also proposed a hyperloop high-speed
                            vactrain transportation system. In 2022, his acquisition
                            of Twitter for $44 billion was completed.
                            <br />

                            Musk has made controversial statements on politics and
                            technology, particularly on Twitter, and is a polarizing
                            figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific
                            and misleading statements, including spreading COVID-19
                            misinformation. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and
                            Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for falsely tweeting
                            that he had secured funding for a private takeover of
                            Tesla. Musk stepped down as chairman of Tesla and paid a
                            $20 million fine as part of a settlement agreement with
                            the SEC.
